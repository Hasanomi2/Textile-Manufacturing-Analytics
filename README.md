# Textile-Manufacturing-Analytics
I have developed a comprehensive Textile Manufacturing Analytics Solution in Power BI covering both TMS (Textile Manufacturing System) and GSM (Garments Sewing & Manufacturing) performance. The dashboards consolidate operational data across knitting, dyeing, finishing, inspection, sewing, cutting, and shipment processes to support production monitoring and decision-making.
🔹 Key Focus Areas
TMS Dashboard
• Knitting Efficiency %
• Knitting Output (KG)
• Dyeing Reprocess Rate %
• Fabric Yield %
• Inspection Pass Rate %

GSM Dashboard
• Cutting Achievement %
• Sewing Efficiency %
• DHU %
• Finishing Achievement %
• On-Time Shipment %

📊Major Visuals & Analytics
• Fabric Yield by Factory
• Pass Rate by Buyer
• Dyeing Reprocess Performance
• Fabric Finishing Output Trend
• Knitting Output Trend
• Daily Production Trend
• Sewing Efficiency by Line
• Cutting Production Trend
• Shipment Status (On-Time vs Delay)

🎯 Business Value Delivered
• Identified process inefficiencies across knitting, dyeing, and finishing
• Enabled factory-wise and buyer-wise quality performance tracking
• Improved visibility of production trends and output fluctuations
• Supported management decision-making using interactive slicers (Year & Month)
• Helped monitor shipment timeliness and operational bottlenecks
